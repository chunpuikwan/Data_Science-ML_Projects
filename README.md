# Data Science Projects
In this repository, I put selected data analysis projects I have done for real-world/ kaggle data by using different machine learning techniques.

To complete each project, I mainly use Python, and some useful libraries in Python, such as NumPy (for vectorization calculation), Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis), Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualization), and sckit-learn (for machine learning). 

- [Predicting house price in Iowa](https://github.com/chunpuikwan/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/House_price_regression)- (**Regression**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Python**)
- [Correlation of national unemployment rate and the VIX index](https://github.com/chunpuikwan/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/unemployment_rate_and%20_VIX)- (**Exploratory data analysis**, **Regression**, **Python**)
