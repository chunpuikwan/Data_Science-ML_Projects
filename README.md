# Data_Science_Projects
In this repository, I put selected data analysis projects I have done for real-world/ kaggle data by using different machine learning techniques.

To complete each project, I mainly use Python, and some useful libraries in Python, such as NumPy (for vectorization calculation), Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis), Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualization), and sckit-learn (for machine learning).
